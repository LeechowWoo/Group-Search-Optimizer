These routines use function used in CEC 2008 benchmark.

Don't forget to add libgso directory onto your path before executing the scripts:
> addpath('<your libgso directory>');

execute_tests.m: execute tests sequencially

eval_gso_f(1..11).m: Invoke this scripts to execute the test. 

f(1..11).m: objective functions
