% Written by Gustavo de Souza (2011)
% Based on the algorithm proposed in the article:
% "Group Search Optimizer: An Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Animal Searching Behavior"
% by He, S., Wu, Q.H. and Saunders, J.R.
%
% Parameters:
% @fobj: objective function
% U: vector (1 x n) with upper limits, where n is the number of dimensions
% L: vector (1 x n) with lower limits, where n is the number of dimensions
% options: options structure for algorithms
% popsize: population size
% nproducers: number of producers
% nscroungers: number of scroungers (in % of population)
% a: range constant
% tmax: maximum pursuit angle
% amax: maximum turning angle
% lmax: maximum pursuit distance
% niterations: maximum number of iterations
% deviation: maximum deviation
% stall: number of iterations within deviation which will stall the optimization
% verbose: verbose level
