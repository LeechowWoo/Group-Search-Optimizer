GSO group search optimizator
Written by Gustavo de Souza (2011)
Based on the algorithm proposed in the article:
"Group Search Optimizer: An Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Animal Searching Behavior"
by He, S., Wu, Q.H. and Saunders, J.R.

-------------
   Usage
-------------
First you need to load the default options:
octave> options=gsoptions();

Now you can change the parameters in the options structure as needed.
options.a           = 6;
options.tmax        = pi/3;
options.amax        = pi/6;
options.niterations = 3000;
options.nscroungers = 0.8;
options.nproducers  = 1;
options.error       = 0;
options.popsize     = 48;
options.elitesize   = 10;
options.stall       = 10;
options.verbose     = 0;
options.lmax        = 100;

Run gso:
octave> [x fit] = gso(@objective,U,L,options);

  Parameters
--------------
@objective: objective function
U: vector (1 x n) with upper limits, where n is the number of dimensions
L: vector (1 x n) with lower limits, where n is the number of dimensions
options: options structure for algorithms
	popsize: population size
	nproducers: number of producers
	nscroungers: number of scroungers (in % of population)
	a: range constant
	tmax: maximum pursuit angle
	amax: maximum turning angle
	lmax: maximum pursuit distance
	niterations: maximum number of iterations
	deviation: maximum deviation
	stall: number of iterations within deviation which will stall the optimization
	verbose: verbose level
